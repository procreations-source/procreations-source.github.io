				<p>We are a global, multilingual collective of highly accomplished journalists, authors, photographers,
					artists and filmmakers documenting, investigating and witnessing our world.

					We approach our work with integrity, passion, and respect. We believe stories have an impact and
					inspire action. We believe in the power of still and moving images. We are honest witnesses.</p>
				<p> We have become industry leaders, producing images for large media companies and small
					startups, institutional clients and non-profits. The greatest characteristic of a portrait
					photographer is his initiation, his compassion, his ability to judge a person, his ability to get
					along with all kinds of people, from a poet, a mathematician or a politician. His ability to have
					sympathy for each person and to understand the person he is photographing, to show tact and
					understanding of the problem the person faces, being before a camera. His photographs speak a fluent
					language of brevity, distant sweetness which invites investigation. For every photographer there
					exists a framework according to which he attempts to conduct his subjects.</p>
				<p>
					We also teach, host workshops and public programs around photography, media literacy and
					representation. And while the content of our work is broad, it is unified in our desire to connect
					the dots around critical issues such as climate change, over consumption, forced migration, the rise
					of authoritarianism, the injustices of patriarchy and the power of art and music to keep us human.
